# FlipFlop
Modified FlipDot puck

This is a modification of a design by LarryBuilds. This FlipFlop is designed to be 3d printed in 2 halves.

Notes:
1. 2 piece design allows for the following:
	a. Each side can be printed in a diferent color
	b. Magnet is fully encapsulated by print
	c. recess for pivot pin is incorporated.
2. As these will be glued fused together I recomend the following print settings:
	a. 20%-40% infill dependant on desired final mass
	b. 2-3 shells
	c. no top face so internal voids are exposed allowing for adhesive. (face may be desirable if using ABS and chemical bonding)
3. The Onshape file has variables to control the geometry including the magnet diameter, magnet thickness, Flip dot thinkness, diameter, pin diameter ect.
4. Pivot pin: I thought it might be benificial to have a seperate axel. this could be a short length of filament, nail, or longer rod that supports multiple flipdots.
